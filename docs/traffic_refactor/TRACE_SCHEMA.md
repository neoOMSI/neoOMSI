# Traffic AI refactor — decision/blocked-reason capture specification

This specifies the minimum diagnostic capture to add at the Stage 1 seam, and the first
extraction boundary. The capture must explain every vehicle decision without changing it.
The existing `OMSI_TRACE_AI` frame dump and `AiCar` hints (see
[TEST_INVENTORY.md](TEST_INVENTORY.md)) are the starting point; this schema is versioned and
replayable, unlike those ad-hoc dumps.

## Versioning

- `TRACE_VERSION` is a single integer. Any field addition, removal, or semantic change bumps
  it. It is currently **8**: Stage 10 adds `GroundUnavailable`, `SceneryBlocked` and
  `EmergencyYield`, and road odometers now count realized motion after a rejected step.
  Stage 9 added the `Horn { vehicle, reason }` event (a documented
  provisional `ev_AI_Horn` trigger; presentation feedback only) and centralized parameter
  provenance. Stage 8 added the per-vehicle `lifecycle`
  (`Active`/`Dormant`/`Pending`/`Removed`), the spawn-denial reasons `NoPath`, `NoGround`,
  `AtCapacity` and `EntranceBusy`, and the lifecycle events `SpawnRetried`, `DormantEntered`,
  `DormantReactivated` and `TopologyRequested`, the single writer of admission being
  `traffic::population`; Stage 7 had added `maneuver_phase`/`maneuver_target`; Stage 6 had
  added `service_phase`, `berth_owner` and `service_stop`; Stage 5 had added
  `junction_state`/`junction_blocker`; Stage 4 had added the `motion_feedback` fields.
- A capture writes a header record containing `trace_version`, `source_revision`, `platform`,
  `seed`, `tick_hz`, `network_version`, and the ordered-input digest.
- Unknown fields are read as absent; readers reject a mismatched major `trace_version`.

## Ordered inputs (replay boundary)

A capture is replayable only if the inputs are ordered and timestamped before they mutate
domain state. Capture these once per tick, before the snapshot is frozen:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `tick` | Monotonic simulation tick index |
| `sim_time` | Elapsed simulation time (s), distinct from calendar/service time |
| `calendar_time` | `day_time` used by schedules |
| `network_update` | Ordered map/tile add/remove with `network_version` |
| `script_feedback` | Timestamped vehicle script outputs (door/station/release) |
| `passenger_requests` | Stop wishes and door requests with stable person IDs |
| `schedule_commands` | Duty/trip assignments and handovers |
| `external_actors` | Player, remote/LAN, parked, trailer, rail, pedestrian inputs with stable IDs |
| `player_remote_input` | Timestamped player/remote control state for deterministic replay |

## Per-tick snapshot record

One record describes the frozen world for a tick. Spatial indexes are derived from these
realised bodies; they are not stored.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tick`, `sim_time`, `network_version` | u64, f64, u64 | Identity of the tick |
| `signal_state[]` | list | Each signal: stable id, aspect, remaining/phase, request state |
| `vehicles[]` | list | See below |

Per vehicle:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `VehicleId` | Stable, survives container reordering |
| `class`, `role` | enum | Physical class; bus service role and duty identity separate |
| `pose` | pos + yaw/pitch/bank | Realised physical pose (single pose owner) |
| `velocity` | v + yaw rate | Realised, not controller-desired |
| `footprint[]` | list | Swept/extent segments including trailers/articulation |
| `route` | `(TripId, route occurrence, progress)` | Lane plus distance along the directed occurrence |
| `constraints[]` | list | **All** active causes, not just the nearest |
| `binding_constraint` | ref/id or none | The constraint that currently binds |
| `service_phase` | enum | See below |
| `junction_state` | enum | See below |
| `junction_blocker` | id or none | The vehicle it currently waits for at a junction |
| `service_phase` | enum | See below |
| `berth_owner` | id or none | Who owns the berth the vehicle is at or waiting for |
| `service_stop` | `StopId` or none | The stop whose berth it is at or waiting for |
| `maneuver_phase` | enum | See below; written only by `traffic::maneuvers` |
| `maneuver_target` | `LaneId` or none | The lane a lane change is moving over to this tick |
| `lifecycle` | enum | See below; written only by `traffic::population` |
| `motion_feedback` | | Commanded vs realised accel/speed, applied steering/speed bounds |
| `why` | reason + gap | Convenience projection of the binding constraint |

## Constraint / reason candidates

A constraint carries `reason`, `owner` (blocker/claim id), `validity`, `provenance`, and
either a route-relative stopping location or a speed bound. Preserve every active cause and
identify the binding one separately. Initial reason set:

```text
RedSignal, Amber, Yield, OccupiedExit, JunctionClaim, Leader, Pedestrian,
BerthBusy, DoorHold, StationRelease, RoutePending, InvalidRoute, SpeedLimit,
Curvature, StopTarget, MissedStop, ScriptTimeout, Parking, PullOut, Passing,
Emergency, StaleClaim, Removed, NoPath, NoGround, AtCapacity, EntranceBusy,
Unknown(u16)
```

`NoPath`, `NoGround`, `AtCapacity` and `EntranceBusy` are the typed spawn-denial causes
(`traffic::population`): an invalid/uncontinuable path, unloaded ground, a full population
budget, and a busy entrance that retries later. `AtCapacity`/`EntranceBusy` are valid waits
(a diagnosed capacity limit is not a fault). `Unknown(..)` exists so unresolved legacy
mechanisms (for example the exact `[crossingproblem]` / `[blockpath]` semantics) are captured
as data with provenance rather than discarded or guessed.

## Junction and service state enums

```text
JunctionState = Approaching | Waiting | Admitted | Inside | Cleared
ServicePhase  = EnRoute | Approach | WaitingForBerth | Docking | Boarding
              | ClosingDoors | WaitingToMerge | Departing
              | Layover | NextTrip | OutOfService | RoutePending | ServiceFault(reason)
ManeuverPhase = Idle | RouteChange | LaneChange | Passing | PassingAbort
              | Parking | PullOut | Docking | Departing
Lifecycle     = Active | Dormant | Pending | Removed
```

Some phases may share code, but their transition conditions must remain explicit. A free
curb stop may pass through `WaitingForBerth` immediately. `ManeuverPhase` is the lateral half
of a maneuver and is owned by `traffic::maneuvers`; `Docking`/`Departing` are the service
owner's berth lateral request as the maneuver owner approves it. `Lifecycle` is owned by
`traffic::population`: a `Dormant` actor keeps its identity and duty but has no body, and
`Pending` demand has not been admitted onto the road yet.

## Transition events

Emit exactly once per transition, each with `tick`, `sim_time`, and the stable IDs involved:

```text
StopArrival, BoardingPermission, CloseRequest, Departure, TripComplete,
DutyHandover, Fault(reason), Removal(reason), ClaimGranted, ClaimReleased,
BerthGranted, BerthReleased, SpawnAdmitted, SpawnDenied(reason),
SpawnRetried(request), DormantEntered(vehicle), DormantReactivated(vehicle),
TopologyRequested(tile), Horn(vehicle, reason)
```

`schedule`, passengers, scripts, and LAN adapters consume these through typed boundaries.
Removal must notify schedule and passengers and release resources exactly once.
`SpawnAdmitted`/`SpawnDenied` are the population owner's decisions; `DormantEntered`/
`DormantReactivated` are the logical dormant lifecycle, and `TopologyRequested` records a
loaded tile wanted ahead of a route frontier. `Horn` records a provisional `ev_AI_Horn`
dispatch; it is presentation feedback only and never resolves a blocked maneuver (the exact
legacy trigger is unestablished).

## Valid waits vs errors

Classify waits to avoid treating legitimate service as failure:

| Class | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Valid wait | Red/amber signal, boarding/dwell, timing-point or layover, physically full road, player obstruction |
| Suspect | Stationary or crawling with no valid-wait reason; cyclic blockers; contradictory claims; invalid route; impossible service transition |
| Error | Body overlap, conflicting grants, red entry, boarding permission away from a valid berth, departure with a held/unsafe door |

## Rolling trace and automatic capture

- Keep a bounded rolling buffer of the last N ticks (N set so a capture covers at least the
  longest scenario deadline; provisional default recorded with `TRACE_VERSION`).
- Automatically persist the buffer plus surrounding ordered inputs when a trigger fires:
  unexplained stationary/crawling, cyclic blocker detection, body overlap, contradictory
  claims, invalid route, or impossible service transition. `Emergency` reasons are also
  captured with context but classified separately.
- A capture is self-contained: header + ordered inputs + snapshot records + events. It must
  replay to the same decision/event hash on the same platform.

## Replay determinism

- Replay consumes the ordered inputs at the recorded ticks and must reproduce the same
  sequence of decisions and events. Compute a rolling **decision/event hash** over granted
  actions and emitted events; seed repeat runs must match on the same platform.
- Reordering storage or changing worker count must not change the hash. Cross-platform
  comparison uses documented floating-point tolerances, not bit-for-bit physics.
- Shadow comparison of the old runtime must be read-only: no scripts, events, spawns, or
  reservations. Once trajectories diverge, compare invariants and outcomes rather than
  exact trace equality.

## First extraction boundary

The first boundary, specified now and created in Stage 1, is a small headless
`crates/traffic` domain crate plus a `crates/core/src/traffic_runtime/` integration facade.
Dependency direction: `traffic` depends only on basic math and justified geometry
utilities; both `simulation` and `core` may depend on `traffic`; `traffic` never depends on
`core`, `simulation`, rendering, audio, map loading, scripting, or network runtime. The
crate name and layout below are proposals to check against workspace conventions before
creation.

```text
crates/traffic/src/
  lib.rs                  small public API; no gameplay implementation
  ids.rs                  VehicleId, LaneId, StopId, TripId, duty identity
  world.rs                authoritative domain state and step orchestration

  rules.rs                content-derived legal rules and movement permissions

  service.rs              scheduled stop and trip state transitions
  population.rs           demand/admission bookkeeping, not asset loading
  diagnostics.rs          typed reasons, trace records, health classification

  mod.rs                  integration facade
  content.rs              map/route/vehicle capability translation
  vehicles.rs             motion realisation and script handshake
  passengers.rs           stop wishes, doorway holds, service events
  presentation.rs         rendering and audio synchronisation
  replication.rs          host snapshots and client presentation
```

Migration rule: keep `simulation::traffic` re-exports where necessary so scenery,
passengers, rail, and existing tests migrate separately. Shared network primitives retain
`LaneKind` for street, sidewalk, rail, and air; road decisions must not run on every path
kind. Keep specialised rail/air motion in `simulation` and adapt its occupancy rather than
forcing it through car following. Delete compatibility facades once callers have migrated.

## Exit gate

The capture schema, its reason/state enums, the automatic-capture triggers, and the first
extraction boundary are specified. Stage 1 can implement all three Stage 0 scenarios
against this schema without replay tooling or a live reproduction.

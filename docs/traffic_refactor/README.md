# Traffic AI refactor — preparation and progress

Stage 0 of the [Traffic AI refactor plan](TRAFFIC_AI_REFACTOR_PLAN.md) was the lightweight
preparation that produced the starting backlog, an integration/test inventory, the first
synthetic scenario specifications, and the decision/blocked-reason capture specification
required at the Stage 1 seam.

Stages 1 (extract boundaries, fixed clock, stable identities, typed reasons), 2 (validate the
network and content semantics), 3 (unified occupancy, perception and snapshot decisions), 4
(following, stopping and motion correctness), 5 (junction admission and recovery), 6 (bus
service, berths and duty lifecycle), 7 (lateral maneuvers and passing) and 8 (population,
streaming and recovery) have since landed; see the progress sections in
[BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) and [DEPENDENCIES.md](DEPENDENCIES.md) for what is done and what
remains. Stage 4 makes the realized body the single pose owner; Stages 5–8 add the
`traffic::junctions`, `traffic::service`, `traffic::maneuvers` and `traffic::population`
owners, each reading a frozen per-tick scene and returning typed decisions while `core` stays
the adapter.

Stage 9 (calibration, performance, cutover and legacy deletion) has landed: parameter
provenance is centralized, the domain benchmark and accelerated soak measure and guard the
budgets, `ev_AI_Horn` is restored as presentation-only feedback, and the `simulation::traffic`
shim plus the dead `OMSI_TRAFFIC_RUNTIME` selector were removed so **one** production road-AI
runtime remains. See [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) and
[MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md](MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md).

Stage 10 adds physical ground/scenery safeguards, complete passing-path validation
(including issue #126), cooperative emergency traffic and corrected merge priority at
roundabout entries. See [STAGE10_REPORT.md](STAGE10_REPORT.md) for fixes, evidence and
remaining map-content limitations.

- Source revision: `35a460a54e51ed28f9fb081b4adf16c8c73993a8` (the plan's `35a460a`).
- Reference baseline: OMSI 2.2.032 (see [Compatibility](../COMPATIBILITY.md)).
- Reproduction of the original queue screenshot is **not** required for Stage 0. Missing
  reproduction data is recorded as unknown and is never promoted into a claimed diagnosis.

## Exit gate

Stage 1 may start once the first extraction boundary and the Stage 0 scenarios are
specified. Stage 1 does not require a live queue reproduction, an OMSI recording session,
completed replay tooling, or a benchmark suite. Those become part of the continuous
validation track that runs alongside Stages 1–9.

## Scope boundaries

Stage 0 is documentation only. Creating `crates/traffic`, the scenario runner, fixed
ticking, and any change to `Traffic`, `BusService`, or `schedule` belong to Stage 1 and
later stages. Where this folder states a fact that is not proven by source or reference
material, it is labelled `unknown` or `uncertain` rather than asserted.

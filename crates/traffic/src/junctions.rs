//! Junction coordinator: admission, commitments, fairness, release, and the wait-for graph.
//!
//! One owner decides who may enter a junction and why. Planning reads a frozen [`JunctionScene`]
//! and returns a [`JunctionDecision`]; it never mutates another vehicle. Commitments (the lanes
//! a vehicle has claimed and the exit storage it holds) are keyed by stable [`VehicleId`] and
//! released only on tail clearance, route change, removal, or network invalidation. A clock
//! timeout never erases a body that still occupies a conflict area.
//!
//! The content rules come first:
//! - `[crossingproblem]` (`Lane::crossing_problem`) marks a **keep-clear** path: it may not be
//!   entered (nor speculatively reserved) unless the whole movement can be cleared, so the
//!   junction is not blocked.
//! - `[blockpath] <path> <mode>` is a typed [`BlockMode`]. The reference parser only proves the
//!   two values are stored; the decision meaning below is a documented neoOMSI interpretation
//!   (Stage 5):
//!   - [`BlockMode::Occupy`] (0): the paths conflict while a body actually occupies one of them.
//!   - [`BlockMode::Reserve`] (1): a speculative reservation alone refuses the other's claim
//!     (reservation refusal).
//!   - [`BlockMode::Oncoming`] (2): the other is the oncoming/return path; this vehicle may
//!     reserve but must not enter until the other has committed (entry refusal).
//!
//! ## Tuning provenance
//!
//! The decision-zone constants below carry their unit and rationale on each item; they are
//! **provisional** neoOMSI targets. The legality itself is **content** (`[blockpath]`,
//! `[crossingproblem]`, signal programs). The full table is in
//! `docs/traffic_refactor/MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md`.

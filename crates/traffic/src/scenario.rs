//! Minimal headless scenario runner.

//! A scenario is a fixed-step loop with no renderer and no OMSI assets. The step closure
//! receives the tick index, elapsed simulation time, and the [`Capture`] to record into;
//! it owns the world and pushes snapshots/events. This is the seam the Stage 0 scenarios
//! (S1–S3) and later automatic captures run on.

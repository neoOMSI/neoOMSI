//! Stage 6 exit gate — optional/request stops, timing points, early/late and layovers.

//! Dwell and skip policy follow explicit service semantics: an unwanted mid-route stop is
//! skipped, a wanted or marked stop is served, a bus early for its departure waits with the
//! doors open at a timing point only (elsewhere it leaves once the exchange is over), a late
//! bus goes at once, and a layover waits its departure out of the lane.
